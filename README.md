Rcade is an unity application that provides exercise recommendations to manage common body pains, Rcade goes above and beyond by incorporating gamification to encourage user engagement and commitment to their exercise routines.
We have used Mediapipe to track body postures. For user authentication and storing game-related user data, we utilized Node.js with Express.js written in Typescript. The application itself was built in Unity and includes three games focused on alleviating shoulder, neck, and hip pain.
Rcade differs from traditional fitness apps by focusing on exercises that specifically target common body pains, making it a unique wellness platform. Our app caters to individuals of all fitness levels, ensuring inclusivity and making it accessible to anyone seeking pain relief through exercise.
